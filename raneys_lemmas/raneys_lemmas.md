# Notes on Raney's Lemmas

In a 1960 paper, George Raney proved
the following two lemmas on cyclic shifts of a finite sequence
that contain positive-only partial sums [@raney].
This note expands on these lemmas.

I personally learned of these lemmas in chapter 7 of
the book Concrete Mathematics [@concrete],
which explores their applications to generating functions.

## Exact rules for finite integer sequences

### Lemma 1

Suppose $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1$, where all $x_i\in\mathbb{Z}$.
Extend the sequence by letting $x_{n+p}=x_p$ for $1\le p\le n$.
Then there is a unique $j$, $1 \le j \le n$, such that

$$\sum_{i=j}^{j+k-1} x_i > 0; \quad 1 \le k \le n.$$

Intuitively, we can think of such an index $j$ as a cyclic shift
of the sequence that has partial sums that are all positive.

For example, the finite sequence
$\langle x_1, \ldots, x_5\rangle = \langle 3, -2, 4, -1, 1 \rangle$
offers $j=5$ as the unique shift providing
$\langle x_5, x_6=x_1, \ldots, x_9=x_4\rangle = \langle 1, 3, -2, 4, -5\rangle$
with partial sums
$\langle 1, 4, 2, 6, 1\rangle$ that are all positive.
